# SOC_25-CP

In the first week, I revisited essential C++ concepts learned in CS101, ensuring a strong grasp of language fundamentals. I was introduced to backtracking and basic bit operators which are crucial for algorithmic thinking. The week also included understanding elementary data structures like vectors and arrays, with a preference for vectors due to their flexibility. I read about the Big O notation to analyze time and space complexity. Additionally, I practiced solving problems related to binary search and sorting, including learning how to use in-built sorting functions and custom comparators in C++.

The second week was about getting familiar with frequently used data structures in competitive programming. I read about stacks, queues, deques, priority queues (heaps), sets, maps, unordered sets, and pairs, practicing essential operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal for each. I also read about core sorting algorithms and binary search. Furthermore, I explored bit manipulation techniques, which are used in optimization and low-level computational problems.

The third week introduced me to the fundamentals of graph theory. I learned about different ways to represent graphs and studied key traversal algorithms, Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), with an initial focus on undirected graphs. Then, I began exploring DFS in the context of directed graphs. Throughout the week, I applied these concepts by solving a variety of graph-related problems, which helped me understand these concepts better.

The fourth week was a buffer week.

In the fifth week, I learned about more complex graph algorithms. I was introduced to spanning trees and shortest path algorithms, with the implementation of Dijkstra’s, Prim’s, and Kruskal’s algorithms. These algorithms are useful for solving a wide range of graph problems, particularly those involving minimum spanning trees and shortest paths. I also learned about the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure, which is used for efficiently managing connectivity in graphs.
