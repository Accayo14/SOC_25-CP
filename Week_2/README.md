Roadmap
This week focuses on mastering frequently used data structures in competitive programming such as stacks, queues, sets, maps, unordered sets, pairs, and heaps. Additionally, we revisit core sorting algorithms and binary searchâ€”critical tools in problem-solving. We'll also explore efficient bit manipulation techniques that frequently appear in optimization-based and low-level computational problems.

1. Understanding Core Data Structures
    - STL Stack 
    - Queue and Deque 
    - Priority Queue / Heap 
    - Sets and Maps 
    - Unordered Maps/Sets 
    - Ordered Sets 
2. Sorting Algorithms and Binary Search
3. Bit Manipulation
